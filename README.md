## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use NYC Citi Bike data to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid buisness proposal.  We are able to create a number of visualizations to show one of the key stakeholders.  These include: the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.  


## Results

August Peak Hours: In this bar graph, we can see that the most rides occur from 8-10am and 5-7pm. This is most likely due to work commuting.

## Summary

Overall, the largest population of riders comes from people who are subscribers to Citi Bike.  I would suggest having a promotion and incentive for subscribing either to a weekly or monhtly membership when first opening the company.  Male riders are the higher population of riders, and the most common rides are during rush hour hours in the morning and after work for commuters.  I would also suggest making bike stations near corporate offices and other locations with a large number of employees.  It might be a good idea to reach out to the major corporations in the area to discuss membership plans and other incentives.  

Another point to consider is additional costs, such as bike repairs.  
Check out this chart that shows the bike repairs in NYC.  For example, Bike ID #32693 was used 197 times in the month of August.

Some bikes happen to be used more often than others, causing some bikes to need repairs more often than others.  Below is a visualization of the bike utilization in NYC. For example, Bikeid 15374 had a trip duration of 2,515,716 seconds.
